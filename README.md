Event-List: On hover for the map link add a banner that follows the cursor saying "click here to map" or something
Event-List: make the times more readable (Perhaps LiveEvent DTO that has easily readable stringsm, and a converter to make it happen?)
Song-List: figure out pagination
Song/Event Lists: merge into a single view instead of component so they can take up half the screen
Set-List-List: Make a setlist DTO that takes the name and ID of the event it was played at.


1. adjust colors of button fades for readability
